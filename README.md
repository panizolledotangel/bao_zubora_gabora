# Zubora Gabora Problem (Lectures in BAO)
This repository contains the code for the Zubora Gabora problem, which is a problem that is used in the lectures of the course "Bioinspired Algorithms for Optimization" at the Polytechnical University of Madrid.

The repository contains the following folders and files:
- `zubora_gabora/ga`: This folder contains the implementation of GA for solving the problem.
- `zubora_gabora/aco`: This folder contains the implementation of ACO for solving the problem.
- `zubora_gabora/experiment`: This folder contains code for experimental testing of the algorithms.
- `data`: This folder contains the datasets used in the experiments.
- `experiments`: This folder contains the results of the experiments.
- `run_ga.ipynb`: This file contains the code for running the GA algorithm.
- `run_aco.ipynb`: This file contains the code for running the ACO algorithm.
- `compare_results.ipynb`: This file contains the code for statistically comparing the results achieved by the algorithms, and also plotting the results.
